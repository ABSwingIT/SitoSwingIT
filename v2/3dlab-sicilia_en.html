              Within the framework of <strong>P.O. FESR SICILIA 2014/2020</strong>, 
              <strong>Thematic Objective 1 – </strong>Research, Technological Development and Innovation, 
              <strong>Specific Objective 1.1 </strong>- Increasing business innovation activity,
              <strong> Action 1.1.5 </strong>- Support for the technological advancement of companies 
              through the financing of pilot lines and early product validation and large-scale demonstration actions, 
              the <strong>Project 3DLab - Sicily - Creation of a regional network for the provision of innovative services based on advanced visualization technologies</strong> was funded.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              The growing and increasingly affordable availability of 3D scanners, sophisticated photogrammetry systems, 
              and software environments rich in features, combined with fixed and wearable devices for high-immersion experiences, 
              has made possible the creation of a genuine market for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). 
              According to IDC’s Worldwide Semiannual Augmented and Virtual Reality Spending Guide, 
              global AR and VR revenues are expected to exceed 150 billion USD in a few years, with extremely high annual compound growth rates. 
              VR applications are now widespread across many sectors such as medicine, biology, automotive, manufacturing, cultural heritage, 
              public administration, the Internet of Things, architecture, gaming, advertising, online sales, communication and marketing, 
              tourism, publishing, fashion, education, and training. 
              The integration of VR into business processes—such as design, production, simulation, maintenance, and safety—is also rapidly expanding. 
              Therefore, it is no surprise that advanced VR/AR visualization laboratories are continuously being established and developed 
              across academic and industrial environments, often under public-private co-management. 
              Notably, the European Commission has funded the VISIONAIR project, successfully creating a continental network of over 20 VR 
              and 3D visualization centers, validated with about 200 projects and applications spanning cultural heritage, biology, chemistry, 
              engineering, mechatronics, medicine, and industrial production.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              3DLab-Sicily aims to create, develop, validate, and promote a sustainable regional network of three (3) 
              VR/AR and 3D visualization centers: one located in the province of Catania (at SWING:IT), 
              one in Troina (EN, at IRCCS-OASI), and one in Palermo (at IEMEST). 
              This network—believed to be the first of its kind in Sicily—is referred to as the “3DLab-Sicily infrastructure.” 
              The project also validates and demonstrates the equipment and services of the infrastructure 
              through a series of “use cases” (some identified during proposal preparation and others selected competitively during the project) 
              aligned with the Smart Specialisation Strategy (S3) of the Sicilian Region. 
              These applications and products may be brought to market and generate profit after the project’s conclusion. 
              Additional goals include linking the infrastructure with VISIONAIR to develop international markets 
              and defining post-project management, business, and sustainability models. 
              A major element of the 3DLab-Sicily work plan—fully embracing Open Innovation and Open Innovation 2.0 concepts, 
              with triple and “quadruple helix” engagement—is to establish within the infrastructure a service inspired by the concept of the “liquid lab.” 
              “Liquid labs” (known in industry as “liquid studios”) are real and virtual environments leveraging innovative ICT solutions 
              to help companies accelerate their innovation path by turning ideas into concrete applications and services 
              through the use of innovative technologies, intelligent automation, and new software development methods. 
              The 3DLab-Sicily liquid lab is designed and implemented to (i) enable the rapid development of VR/AR and 3D visualization applications 
              and (ii) provide full support to all innovation stakeholders within the “quadruple helix.” 
              The thematic area of intervention under the regional innovation strategy for S3 specialization and the technology used is 
              "<strong>Smart Cities & Communities</strong>", particularly in the sub-area "<strong>Smart Economy</strong>".

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              The total project amount is <strong>€3,996,985.59</strong>; the grant amount is <strong>€3,567,561.18</strong>.
