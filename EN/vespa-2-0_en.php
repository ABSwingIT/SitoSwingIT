            <p style="text-align: justify;">Within the P.O. FESR SICILIA 2014/2020, Thematic Objective 1 – Research, Technological Development and Innovation, Specific Objective 1.1 - Increase in business innovation activity, Action 1.1.5 - Support for technological advancement of businesses through funding for pilot lines and early validation and large-scale demonstration of products, the VESPA 2.0 Project - Virtual Environment for a Superior neuro-Psychiatry Second Generation was funded.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The "Virtual Environment for a Superior neuro-Psychiatry" Second Generation (VESPA 2.0) project continues the previous activities in promoting health and the use of innovative solutions for the psycho-physical well-being of individuals in conditions of greater vulnerability and neuro-fragility, in synergy and as a continuation of the VESPA project (PO FESR 2007-2013, https://youtu.be/35C6OwLMkz8). The primary research areas are developed through the analysis, review, and adoption of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>technologies and models for cognitive stimulation and learning;</li>
              <li>user-centered technologies and models aimed at improving the quality of life (health, safety, mobility, social inclusion) of identified end users;</li>
              <li>innovative technologies, products, and service models for promoting healthy lifestyles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The VESPA project developed and validated in the laboratory a computerized 3D Virtual Reality (VR) system with high immersion, remotely supervised by healthcare staff located in remote facilities, for the quantitative assessment and rehabilitation of cognitive-motor functions in patients affected by Intellectual Disability (ID), Communication Disorder (CD), or Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). VESPA 2.0 achieves further evolution to 5D, extends to additional pathologies, and validates the VESPA system in highly immersive VR for diagnostic assessment and rehabilitation therapy targeting cognitive-motor functions in subjects affected by cognitive deficits of various etiopathogenesis (Parkinson’s Disease and Multiple Sclerosis). The VESPA 2.0 system is also subject to appropriate validation activities through suitable Clinical Trials. The system collects performance and efficacy data to obtain the appropriate recognition from Competent Authorities as a medical device capable of revolutionizing the approach to cognitive diagnosis and rehabilitation. The potential is enormous. Maximizing social impact requires that the system further evolves towards richer services whose effectiveness is already demonstrated, also aimed at home use. Through available technologies, this allows the implementation and achievement of the capillarity of a key offering for the SSN. VESPA 2.0 integrates: a centralized database for individual user results, automatic rehabilitation program update and tele-supervision services, support for the health record; it leverages the potential of intensive computing, Big Data, and the latest innovations in highly immersive VR, through strong synergy among partners.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Thematic intervention area of the regional innovation strategy for specialization S3 and technology used: "Life Sciences", sub-area "Methodologies and technologies for rehabilitation (degenerative diseases, quality of life)".</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The project amount is €2,992,285.81; the grant amount is €2,578,047.81.</p>
