              EUreka3D-XR is a project representing the evolution of EUreka3D, funded by the European Union's Digital Europe Programme. Its goal is to develop innovative scenarios and tools for reuse, enabling the creation of extended reality (XR) applications. This project expands the functionalities and services already created and tested in the previous EUreka3D project.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              The main research focus of EUreka3D-XR is the transformation of cultural content (such as 2D images, 3D models, videos, texts, maps, and stories) into engaging extended reality experiences. Additionally, the project aims to make these scenarios available in the European Common Data Space for cultural heritage, contributing to enriching the digital cultural heritage with open access online and inspiring the adoption of new technologies.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              EUreka3D-XR will provide five open-source digital tools, including online services and mobile apps, to promote innovative use and more engaging interaction with 3D cultural resources in various contexts. All activities will be carried out collaboratively, sustainably, and by leveraging advanced technologies such as XR, applied to cultural heritage.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              The project also includes three exhibition scenarios, which will be made available in the Data Space as content and documentation:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Virtual visualization of the medieval walls of Girona.</li>
              <li>XR storytelling of excavations at the Bibracte archaeological site.</li>
              <li>Creation of a new version of San Neophytos Englystra in Cyprus in virtual space.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              EUreka3D-XR will ultimately foster the development of skills and the reuse of digitized cultural heritage among professionals in the cultural sector and in other fields such as education, tourism research, and conservation.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              SWING.IT participates in the project as a technology partner. Its activities involve applying Artificial Intelligence to create 3D models from 2D images and developing XR/AR experiences for the project’s three scenarios.
