              The Age-SenseAI project presents an innovative and multidisciplinary approach, developed to integrate Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies into cognitive training and environmental comfort assessment pathways. One goal is to create immersive scenarios that simulate daily activities, allowing users to train their cognitive functions in an engaging, motivating, safe, and scientifically monitorable environment.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              The distinctive feature of the activities carried out within the project is the ability to reproduce real-life situations without the strict need for physical objects and materials, reducing costs.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              By integrating VR headsets, Living Lab sensors, and wearable devices, it is possible to measure physiological parameters and behavioral responses in real time, ensuring an objective and personalized analysis.
