            <p style="text-align: justify;">Swing-It, as project leader, carried out the project "<strong>Virtual Environment for a Superior neuro-PsichiAtry</strong>" - <strong>VESPA</strong>, funded under the POR Sicilia 2007/2013, Line of intervention 4.1.1.1., whose primary goal is to develop a <strong>computerized immersive Virtual Reality system</strong>, remotely supervised by healthcare staff in remote facilities, for the quantitative assessment and rehabilitation of cognitive-motor functions, among others, in individuals with Intellectual Disability, Specific Language Deficits, or Alzheimer’s Dementia. The VESPA system can be <strong>installed in hospitals, schools, residential facilities</strong>, etc.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Project VESPA is carried out by an ATS consortium of companies and research organizations.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The VESPA System will enable numerous children and elderly people to carry out daily cognitive-motor rehabilitation directly at school or in residential facilities, guaranteeing continuity of education and care</strong> and finally solving the problem for caregivers who need to pick up and drop off children at school or residential facilities after taking them to cognitive-motor rehabilitation centers.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The VESPA System is <strong>the first device in the world</strong> for the assessment and rehabilitation of cognitive-motor functions (3D visuo-spatial abilities, 3D visual and spatial attention, 3D verbal and spatial visual learning-memory, executive functions, abstract thinking, etc.) in immersive Virtual Reality, integrating the possibility of videoconference supervision (tele-supervision) by specialized staff.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In immersive Virtual Reality, the person manipulates virtual objects within virtual reality scenarios, experiencing emotions and tactile sensations through instrumented gloves (immersive digital environment). Compared to any other commercial system, the VESPA System offers the ability to <strong>assess numerous cognitive-motor praxic and constructive functions</strong> in 3D space. Performing tasks in 3D allows for the assessment of visuospatial deficits at the perceptual, attentional, and learning-memory levels, associated or not with fine manipulative movement control in 3D and verbal instructions for language comprehension assessment. The results of cognitive-motor tasks are transmitted and processed in real time over the Internet, allowing immediate and effective rehabilitation protocol modulation.</p>
