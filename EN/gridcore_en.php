              <strong>GRIDCORE</strong> (GRID COgnitive REhabilitation) is a project co-funded by the Italian Ministry of Health and the Lazio Region. Launched in February 2013, its main goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of new rehabilitative therapies in patients affected by <strong>Parkinson’s Disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment</strong>, and <strong>Mild Alzheimer’s Disease</strong>.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Within the GRIDCORE project, Software Engineering Italia developed a battery of tasks on <strong>Android tablets</strong> (10") for cognitive assessment in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer’s, as well as in patients with Parkinson’s disease.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              This battery was derived from the company’s products, expertise, and activities, aiming to enable the assessment and validation of the performance of a new and innovative approach to rehabilitation for these patients. Swing:It’s rehabilitative tasks are currently used in hospitals, specialized research centers, and IRCCS facilities across Italy. The application, after GRIDCORE, has been adopted by several scientific research projects in the field.
