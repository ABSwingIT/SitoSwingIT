              CAT-Lab is a project designed as a Living Lab to promote sustainable innovation in agriculture in marginal coastal areas. In a context of increasing environmental pressure and the need for sustainable management of natural resources, CAT-Lab aims to integrate advanced Internet of Things (IoT) solutions to optimize agricultural management in the production of horticultural products in vulnerable areas, addressing specific challenges related to rising salinity of groundwater and variability of water resources.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Through the installation of IoT sensors in the fields, the project will enable continuous data collection on critical parameters such as soil moisture, weather conditions, and nutrient concentration.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              The project adopts a holistic and multidisciplinary approach, integrating artificial intelligence and One Health principles. Monitoring systems are implemented to collect data on ecosystem health and to encourage sustainable agricultural and forestry practices for soil fertility.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              SWING.IT participates in the project as a technology partner. Software Engineering Italia S.r.l. will manage the deployment of the IoT sensor network and the data management platform, integrating advanced algorithms for predictive analysis, thus generating an innovative decision support system (DSS).
