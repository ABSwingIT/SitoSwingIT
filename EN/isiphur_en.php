              The ISIPHUR project combats desertification in the Mediterranean with an innovative and sustainable approach. It aims to promote sustainable development in the Interreg Next Italy-Tunisia area by addressing soil degradation and its consequences.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              ISIPHUR relies on an innovative Decision Support System (DSS) using geospatial technologies and artificial intelligence. This system evaluates vulnerability to desertification in real time, integrating virtual reality (VR, AR, XR) for risk communication.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              The project adopts a holistic and multidisciplinary approach, integrating artificial intelligence and One Health principles. Monitoring systems are implemented to collect data on ecosystem health and encourage sustainable agricultural and forestry practices for soil fertility.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              ISIPHUR’s innovation lies in the integration of technologies and a multidisciplinary approach linking human, animal, and environmental health. Prevention is key, with early monitoring and alert systems aiming to prevent desertification rather than manage it after the fact.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              The project ensures active participation from all stakeholders, from authorities to local communities, guaranteeing effective and shared solutions. The success of ISIPHUR will contribute to environmental protection, food security, health, and social stability in the region.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              SWING.IT participates in the project as a technology partner. SWING.IT will coordinate Working Group 3, supervising, coordinating, and controlling the creation and implementation of the iDMP, including installation and configuration of the Big Data environment and its subsystems. SWING.IT will coordinate the architecture of the iDMP. In collaboration with INAT, coordinator of Working Group 4, SWING.IT will provide its expertise to define, develop, and implement operational strategies for predicting and post-managing desertification risk scenarios (DSS and scenarios).
